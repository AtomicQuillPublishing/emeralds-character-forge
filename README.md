## Overview
This project is a web-based tool designed to assist Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) players in quickly generating random character details such as race, background, and ability scores. The tool provides a simple, user-friendly interface that allows users to pick random D&D races, backgrounds, and roll stats with modifiers, making character creation easier and faster for DMs and players alike.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop use.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the web content.
- **CSS**: Styling the interface, including layout, colors, and font usage.
- **JavaScript**: For random number generation and functionality (race, background, and stat selection).
- **Font Awesome**: For social media icons.
